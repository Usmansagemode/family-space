        <p>
          Family Space is a shared family management platform that lets
          households organise tasks, grocery lists, and chores on a shared
          board — along with expense tracking, yearly analytics, and optional
          Google Calendar sync.
        </p>
        <p>
          The service is available on a Free plan and paid plans (Plus, Pro)
          with expanded features. Feature availability by plan is described on
