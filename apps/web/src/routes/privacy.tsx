          . This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it,
          and your rights regarding your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using Family Space, you agree to the collection and use of
          information in accordance with this policy.

      <Section title="2. Data We Collect">
        <p>
          <strong className="text-foreground">Account information</strong> —
          When you sign in with Google or email, we collect your email address
          and display name. If you sign in with Google, we also receive your
          Google profile picture URL.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-foreground">Family data</strong> — Content
          you create in the app: spaces, tasks, grocery items, chores, and
          expense records. This data is associated with your family account and
          is accessible to other members of your family group.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-foreground">Google Calendar data</strong> —
          If you optionally connect Google Calendar, we access calendar events
          solely to create, update, and delete events that correspond to tasks
          you explicitly assign a date to in Family Space. We do not read,
          store, or process any other calendar data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-foreground">Usage data</strong> — Basic
          server-side logs (timestamps, request paths) retained briefly for
          debugging. We do not track individual user behaviour.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="3. Google OAuth Scopes">
        <p>
          When you sign in with Google, Family Space requests the following
          scopes:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">

            </code>{' '}
            — to authenticate your identity and display your name and avatar.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you optionally connect Google Calendar (in Settings), we
          additionally request:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>

            </code>{' '}
            — to create, update, and delete calendar events for items you
            manage in the app. This scope is only requested at the time you
            enable the integration.

        <p>
          Your data is stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL, hosted on AWS). We
          enforce row-level security (RLS) policies so each family can only
          access their own data. All data is transmitted over HTTPS/TLS.

          While we take reasonable security measures, no system is 100% secure.

          data within 30 days, except where we are required to retain it for
          legal purposes.
